"""
This module tracks active movement (person or object) and dynamically updates it based on motion detected in the scene.
- Active movement is the closest moving person or object.
- If the active person or object stops moving for 5 seconds, it looks for other movement in the scene.
- If no new movement is detected for 5 seconds, the system reverts to the previous active movement.
- The get_image function is rate-limited to a maximum of one call every 30ms to prevent excessive updates.
